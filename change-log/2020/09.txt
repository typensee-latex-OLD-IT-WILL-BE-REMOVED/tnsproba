**New minor version version::``0.11.0-beta``:** see the new feature below.


**Probabilistic tree:** it is now possible to add tags for each level of the tree suchas to indicate their meaning. See the macros ``\ptreeTag``,  ``\ptreeTag*``,  ``\aptreeTag`` or  ``\aptreeTag*``.


**Â¨Doc:** external files are used for the examples of finite random variables.

**New minor version version::``0.10.0-beta``:** see the new important features below and before.


**Generalities:** two changes have been done.

    1) The default name for probabilities is `P` instead of `p`.

    1) The names of probabilities, expected values, variances and standard derivations all use ``\mathrm`` by default.


**Finite random variable:** two enhancements have been done.

    1) The macro ``\expval`` is used in backstage to print the expected values in the calculations.

    1) In the eval step of the calculations, the products all start with the probailites before the values as in the formal sum.

**New minor version version::``0.9.0-beta``:** see the new important features below and before.


**Finite random variable:** the macro ``\calcexpval`` makes it easy to define a finite random variable and to display how to calculate uits expected value.

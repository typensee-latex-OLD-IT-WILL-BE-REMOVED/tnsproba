**Documentation:** a basic example of the values of a random variable placed at the right of a probabilistic tree has been added.


**Backstage machinery:** the too old changelogs are managed automatically now.

**New minor version version::``0.6.0-beta`` of ¨tnsproba:** see the new features below.


**New way to work with automatic names::** dedicated macros have been added.

    1) ``\aptreeFocus``, ``\aptreeFocus*`` and ``\aptreeFocus**``.

    1) ``\aptreeComment``.

    1) ``\aptreeFrame``.


**Backstage:** updates regarding the ¨expl3 changes of the macros ``tns@multi@apply@each`` and ``tns@multi@apply@couple``.

**New minor version version::``0.5.0-beta`` of ¨tnsproba:** see the new features below.


**Probabilistic trees:** two new features.

    1) The macros ``ptreeFocus``, ``ptreeFocus*`` and ``ptreeFocus**`` use now a single multi-argument sucha as to display a path along several nodes.

    1) The key ``pcomment`` has been removed. Instead two new macros ``ptreeComment`` and ``ptreeComment*`` can be used. This simplifies the ¨API.


**Small bug:** in the probabiistic trees the weights displayed using ``apweight`` and ``bpweight`` were not hidden when using the environment ``probatree*``.


**Documentation of the probabilistic trees:** the autonumbering made by the package ``forest`` is explained in a dedicated section.
